# Hi there, Iâ€™m Talish Khan! ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m an aspiring **Data & Analytics professional** passionate about transforming raw data into strategic insights that drive business decisions. Though I'm a fresher, Iâ€™ve already completed several end-to-end analytics projects that showcase my skills in business intelligence, storytelling, and technical tooling.

###  Core Projects & Impact
| Project | Tech Stack | Brief |
|--------|-------------|-------|
| **Financial Risk & Loan Analytics** | Power BI / DAX / Power Query | Built a dynamic dashboard analyzing **loan default risk** across segments, with drill-through analysis for occupations and organizations. |
| **HR Analytics â€“ Employee Attrition & Retention** | Tableau | Created an executive dashboard that highlights which workforce segments (by role, age, education) are most at risk of churn. |
| **Instacart Sales & Reorder Dashboard** | Tableau | Visualized e-commerce customer behavior â€” heatmap of ordering trends and detailed segment reordering insights. |

###  What I Do
- **Perform data cleaning & modeling** using Power BI (Power Query) and Excel.
- **Develop advanced calculations** in DAX and Tableau (LODs, bands, aggregations).
- **Design interactive dashboards** that tell data-driven stories and enable business action.
- **Segment & analyze** users/customers/employees to identify high-risk or high-value groups.
- **Write clear documentation** (README, LinkedIn posts, portfolio descriptions) for sharing insights and processes.
